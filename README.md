## 📘 Overview  
This project presents a full cybersecurity consulting engagement for a simulated healthcare organization managing electronic protected health information (ePHI).  
The goal was to align the clinic’s operations with **HIPAA Security and Privacy Rules**, the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0**, and **ISO/IEC 27001** standards to improve compliance maturity and reduce cyber risk.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Conducted a complete **risk assessment** of the clinic’s technical and administrative environment.  
- Identified vulnerabilities in password management, access control, and data handling.  
- Developed and implemented **HIPAA-compliant policies**:  
  - Access Control Policy  
  - Password Management Policy  
  - Data Handling and Retention Policy  
  - Incident Response Policy  
- Designed **Business Continuity and Data Recovery procedures** aligned with **ISO 22301** and **NIST SP 800-34**.
